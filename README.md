# Hi, Welcome to My Portfolio

This site is a space where creativity meets technology — an introduction to my work, process, and experiments that live at that intersection. It’s part showcase, part conversation, and fully *me*.

## Tech Stack

## Overview
This portfolio highlights projects, writing, and experiments that blend design thinking with engineering.  
It’s clean, fast, and intentionally minimal — because good storytelling doesn’t need clutter.
